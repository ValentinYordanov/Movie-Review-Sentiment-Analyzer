# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analyzer

Simple console application that reads reviews from a file and based on that, gives every word a score that indicates if it's positive, negative or something between them.

| Rating | Rating in words         |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 0       |   negative          |
| 1       |   somewhat negative |
| 2       |   neutral           |
| 3       |   somewhat positive |
| 4       |   positive          |

After 'learning', the program can calculate the rating of a given sentence and say if it is positive, negative or neutral
